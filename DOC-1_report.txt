Do you sometimes feel confused about how to create a chart, graph or table?
Are you not always sure which of these to choose to illustrate your set of data?
Why do we produce charts, graphs and tables anyway?

Spend a few minutes writing down what you think are the reasons why we choose to
present data in this way before you read on.
One student has said:
If an exam or assessment question asks me to draw a chart or a graph,
my heart sinks. I don't like tackling tables either. I only ever draw a graph
if I absolutely have to.
This booklet assumes that you have some experience in drawing conclusions from
tables and graphs, understanding basic statistics and answering questions associated with
charts, graphs and tables. The basics are covered in Student Toolkit 3 Working with
Chorts, Grophs ond Tables but it is not essential to have read it before you start this
booklet. Both booklets are in the Student Toolkit series, and there are others that can
help you with use of English, essay writing, revision and exams, reading and note taking.
and other study skilts. Your Regional Student Services will be able to tell you which
would be appropriate to your needs.
On any one day, if you look at a selection of newspaper or magazine articles, you will
find that a number of them include a chart, graph or table. This is because a chart, graph
or table is a way of making some information that the author wishes to convey to the
reader more obvious. Charts and graphs are generally used to help illustrate the point
that the article is trying to make, whereas a table is a useful way of presenting a lot of
data in a clear and organized manner. All three can provide a summary of the situation
under discussion so that even if the person looking at the article doesn't actually read all
of it they can still get a feel for the argument that the author is presenting.
As an Open University student, the number of charts, graphs and tables that you will be
asked to create wil depend on your course. Many courses do not require you to do
this at al, but others will expect you to be able to produce a chart, graph or table if
necessary. Some courses with little mathematical, scientific or technical content still
require you to analyse data presented in one or other of these forms and draw
conclusions from them. This booklet is primarily aimed at those who are not confident
about their ability to do these tasks and who wish to develop these skills.
This is a practical booklet Section 2 first asks you to reflect on why you decided to
request this booklet and what you hope to gain from it. The section then explores what
your current course expects in the way of numerical work. Sections 3-6 respectively
look at creating tables, line graphs, bar charts and histograms, and pie charts. Section 7
is on analysing data. There is a technical glossary, and also some suggestions for further
sources of help.
We expect you to be an active learner and, as with your course material, we suggest
that you work through this booklet with a pen and paper handy so that you can do the
activities as you go. You will be able to see where we ask you to do some work by the
pencil symbol in the margin.
We anticipate that after you have worked through this booklet you will feel more
confident about your abilities to produce charts, graphs and tables and to analyse data.
Remember, though, that things do not happen instantly and that, as with any skill, it
often takes time and practice to master it completely. If this booklet gives you a better
understanding of how to present data, then it will have achieved its aim.

--- Page 6 ---
You will have decided to ask for this toolkit for your own reasons. We imagine that a
common reason students will ask for this toolkit is a lack of confidence in their
numerical work. However, we do not want to take this for granted. We have written
this section to help you to look at your reasons, so that you can make plans to improve
on one or more areas of mathematics and consider how you can work on the areas that
you need to.
y
ACTIVITY I
Before you start to work through the booklet itself, spend a few minutes thinking about
why you felt that this toolkit would be helpful. In particular, answer the following
questions.
What made me decide to look for help?
Why did it sound as if it would be useful?
What do I hope to gain by using this toolkit?
Don't spend too long on answering these questions. We suggest that you write down
your answers before you look at our suggestions, and keep your answers to return to
later, after you have done some work on the toolkit. Brief notes are enough. It should
take you no more than 1520 minutes at most.
Discussion
The ideas below may be similar to yours or you may find them useful to add to your own.
Your answers may be corpletely different, of course, and we are not suggesting that these
are the 'right' ones — but we hope that they might act as a trigger for you to think about
other things.
What made me decide to look for help?
There are, of course, many reasons why students decide to look for help. It depends on
your ability and confidence in numerical work. We have spoken to other students and
asked them this question, and some of their responses are given below.
I am constantly worried about the use of maths  I always presume that I
will get simple probfems wrong if numbers are invoived.
I am aware that presumed difficulties with maths prevent me from
attempting certain aspects of the course. Basic skiis couid heip my
confidence, though i feel it may be too late to start.
I am aware of an in-built resistance to doing anything invoiving figures!
Why did it sound as if it would be useful?
This may be more difficult to answer. It may be that you have read Student Toolkit 3
Working with charts, graphs and tables and found it helpful. It may be that you feel that you
understand a little about analysing and presenting data, but you are concered that this
may not be enough for your course.
You may feel that you need all the help that you can get and simply hope that this will be
useful in some way that you can't yet define. We believe that the more you can decide on
this sort of question at this stage, the more likely you will be to gain from using this toolkit.

What do I hope to gain by using this toolkit?
This depends very much on the reasons why you asked for this toolkit. However, you
might have included things like the students quoted below.
I can't draw graphs at afl and this material looks as if I will need to do this.
I want to improve my confidence, and feel that I am doing it right, instead
of worrying about it.
I am not very confident with drawing graphs and pie charts, and I have a

--- Page 7 ---
I can handie tables, graphs, and bar charts and analyse them  I am just
not interested in producing them. That must go back to early home
background, I think. I am coming up to a section of my course where we
are doing this, though, and I know that I need to learn.
I am not very confident with statistics, and I know that I will need this for
the next TMA.
One reason that you are likely to be interested in this toolkit is that you realize your
course will require you to carry out some calculations and you don't feel very confident
about this. The next activity asks you to think about the use of mathematics in your
current course. If you haven't started your course yet, skip Activity 2 for the moment
and come back to it once you have made a start on your course.
Nnt
ACTIVITY 2 (PART I)
Courses vary enormously in terms of their mathematical content and in this activity we
suggest that you spend some time looking at your own course to gain an idea of the
sort of mathematical knowledge needed.
To begin with, took at a unit or block of your course and try to identify what the
outcomes of that part of the course are. Different courses have different layouts: you may
find the outcomes at the end of units, or in the Assignment Booklet, the Course Guide or
separate block guides. Once you have found the outcomes, decide which of them are to
do with mathematical understanding, knowledge or skilts. For example: they may say that
you will be able to understand a particular concept, that you will be able to read and
understand mathematics from tables, or that you will be able produce graphs and/or
tables. Now make a list of the mathematics that you are being asked to learn. (You might
need to clarify this with your tutor if you aren't sure about what is required or if
numerical work is not mentioned. It may be that the ability to draw charts or graphs is
assumed by the Course Team, but your tutor or a Regional Adviser wil know this.)
Next, look at the assessment for that part of the course. It may include a TMA, CMA,
an exarninable component or a specimen exam paper, depending on what stage you
have reached in the course. Identify what specific mathematical understanding,
knowledge or skills form part of the assessment. For example, your course may include
project work as part of the assessment. This might include some form of quantitative
assessment, perhaps presenting figures in charts or graphs once you have collected
them.
Discussion
You should now have two lists, one of matheratical topics that are covered in that part of
the course, and one of mathematical skills that are assessed. If you aren't sure about these,
then you may need to either look at the block or unit in more detail, or talk to your tutor
or other students. You could perhaps check this out through a FirstClass conference, if
your course has one.
ACTIVITY 2 (PART 2)
Once you have made your lists, you need to decide on priorities. We suggest that you:
decide on the areas that you need to learn
make a list of these areas in order of priority (the areas may be, for example,
mathematical concepts that you need to learn because they are needed for the
course assessment)
decide to tackle the one that you need to do in the short term as the first priority,
then move on to others
check the rest of this toolkit, to see if what you need is covered directly

--- Page 8 ---
Discussion
Once you have made a list of those mathematical aspects that you need to leam and listed
them according to priority, don't be discouraged if there seerns to be quite a lot that you
need to do. This can be off putting, and you might feel that you want to give up, but by
preparing a prioritized list you should be able to see what you need to tackle most urgently,
and make a plan for that first. Then you can corne back to the rest when you need to.
This toolkit may directly cover your priority areas. If it does, then we suggest that you
turn first to the relevant part or parts in Sections 3-7. If it doesn't, try the list in Section 9
'Further reading and sources of help'.
What we have asked you to do in this section is to look at your experience of
numerical work in the context of your experience as an OU student, as well as in the
past. As you can see from the quotes we have given, other people feel unsure about
their use of mathematics. But now you are ready to look at the rest of the toolkit and
to move on to some practical work on your areas of concern.

--- Page 9 ---
What is a table?
A table should provide a clear summary record of a collection of data. Tables have a
number of columns and rows, depending on the amount of data and the detail shown.
Tables are a very common way of putting information across to people, so common
that we probably don't notice that they are there most of the time. On the other hand,
they can look quite formidable when there is a lot of information presented at once, and
finding your way around them can be hard. To be easy to read, all tables must have a
title and sub-headings. Often, the text around the table will have detaits of where the
information in the table has come from.
When are tables used?
Within your course, tables are likely to be used as a particular structured format to
summarize numerical information. They tend to be used to present data as a summary
and as a starting point for discussion. But someone always prepares tables. So always be
aware of where the table that you are looking at has come from. Could the source be
trying to tell you something in particular? For example, if a table were summarizing the
costs of running a hospital, would you expect figures from the government or the local
administrators to be more accurate? Why is that?
When is a table not a good format to use?
There are very few cases where a table will be the worst format to use. However, when
you have a huge amount of data, you may wish to present some of it in a different
format. Other formats for presenting data are explained in Sections 4-6.
How do I design a table?
As a student, you are likely to present data in a table after you have carried out an
investigation, particularly when you are writing up the report. Some OU courses include
a small-scale project and this is likely to be the point at which knowledge of how to
design a table will be useful. The foltowing steps form a reliable guide.
I Collect the data.
In the case of a project, you are likely to collect the data yourself, possibly from
other written sources (in which case, these should be acknowledged). Atternatively,
you may have been presented with data and asked to design a table.
2
Decide on a clear title.
As with all forms of representation, a clear title is crucial in representing your work
accurately. It should be decided on early so that you remain clear about the
information you wish to show.
3
Decide on the data to be presented.
You need to be able to present data so that there is a helpful amount for someone
make it difficult to reach conclusions from the figures.
4
Decide on the number of rows and columns.
This depends on what you are trying to show in the table. Generally, the more
columns there are, the fewer rows; and vice versa. Otherwise, the table may be
unwieldy.

--- Page 10 ---
5
Decide on the row and column headings.
Do not be afraid to use simple headings that follow from the nature of your data
and what your table is showing. Titles for column and row headings should be clear
and unambiguous (like the title)
6
Draw the table outline.
S
ACTIVITY 3
Imagine that you have been asked to investigate population growth in the EU. You might
be considering the details of population growth or you may be thinking about
representing the reasons for population growth.
Follow the above steps to design and draw a table outline. Try to think briefly about
aspects of population growth that might be represented before you follow the example
in the discussion below. Remember that you are thinking about the design of a table
here, you do not need to complete the table with data.
Discussion
1
Collect the data.
You would probably want to find data on population numbers, perhaps over a five- or
ten-year period. You might also consider nurnbers of children that women in each coun-
try might have, and informnation about mortality rates either among children or across al
age ranges. You might consider emigration, immigration and population growth esti-
mates. You may have thought of other things as well; these are only a guide.
2
Decide on a clear title.
In this case, it could be either 'Population growth in the EU" or "Reasons for population
growth in the EU', depending on the approach that you wish to take.
3
Decide on the data to be presented.
What do you want the table to represent? How complex does it need to be in the
context of your imaginary investigation?
You might decide, for example, that a simple table of data about the population size ten
years ago, today and an estimate for ten years' time (for each EU country) would be
enough.
Altematively, you might decide on something much more complex and look at all of the
issues suggested above. If you do this, you need to decide on the fornat of the data. You
would want something that makes comparisons easy, so you could think about using
infortmation in a 'rate per Tooo' format. For example, the nurnber of children who die
before the age of three, per tooo bom.
4
Decide on the total number of rows and colurnns.
There will sixteen rows (one for the headings and one for each of the fifteen EU coun-
tries at the timne of writing). There will be four colurnns (one for the list of countries and
one for each set of population figures).
5
Decide on the row and colurnn headings.
For the simple table 'Population growth in the EU", the EU countries column can be
headed 'Country, the ten-year-old data column headed "Population in I989 (thousands)',
the current data column headed 'Population in 1999 (thousands)' and the predicted data
column headed 'Population in 20o9 (thousands) (Estimated)'. Each row starts with the
name of an EU country.
6
Draw the table outline.

This table design is easy to understand and clearly labelled. If it were in a project, it would
be easy to see whether or not you had carried out the investigation that you were asked
for.

ACTIVITY 4
Now try an example of your own. Imagine that you have been asked to measure the
pulse rates of three volunteers on ten occasions, at five-minute intervals and design a
table to show the results. As with the example above, you aren't expected to find the
data that would go into the table, just to design an appropriate table in outline. Use the
same six steps again.
Discussion
See Section 10, page 35.

--- Page 12 ---
This section covers line graphs. We define the format, give some ideas about when it
should be used, and draw some graphs. You can have a go at drawing a line graph in
Activity 6, based on data that we supply. The discussion for this activity is in Section I0.
What is a line graph?
A line graph, at its simplest, is a diagram that shows a line joining several points, or a line
that shows the best possible relationship between the points. Sometimes the line will go
through all of the points, and sometimes it will show the best possible fit. The line does
not have to be a straight one; it can be a curve, though the techniques for drawing
curved line graphs are beyond the scope of this toolkit.
When are fine graphs used?
A line graph shows a relationship between two variables. In other words, it shows how
one thing varies by comparison to another. For example, a distance-time graph shows
distance varying against the time of day, or the start time of a jourey. The distance
increases when a vehicle is moving but remains the same when the vehicle is stationary.
When is a line graph not a good format to use?
When you have a large amount of data without an obvious link. For example, when your
data shows shares of a whole, in which case, you would use a pie chart
How do I draw a Iine graph?
The process is as the steps below outline.
I
Collect the data.
In other words, decide on the data that you wish to represent and collect it in a
format that shows one value being compared with another.
2
Decide on a clear title.
You may be able to use the heading of a table from which you are getting data.
Alternatively, you may need to define the title yourself.
3
Decide on the values that you wish to show on the horizontal axis and on the
vertical axis.
When you are showing a relationship between two sets of values, one set always
depends on the other and is called the dependent data. The set of values that is
depended on is called the independent data. Line graphs are drawn so that the
independent data are on the horizontal axis and the dependent data are on the
vertical axis.
Consider, for example, the growth (i.e. increase in height) of a tree over time or
sales of washing powder over time. In these cases, both growth and sales depend
on time. So, in both cases, time is the independent data and would be plotted on
the horizontal axis; tree height or sales figures would be plotted on the vertical
axis.
Axes must always be clearly labelled.
4
Decide on the scale.
This can make a surprising difference to the way that the data looks. Normally, you
should begin the vertical axis from zero.
5
Plot the graph.
It is most usual to use graph paper to do this; although you may decide to use a
computer. The level of accuracy depends on what is required. A sketch needs to be
much less accurate, although it will still need a title and labels for the axes.

ACTIVITY 5
Line graphs are commonly used to show a direct relationship between data. For
example, graphs for conversions between one amount and another, such as degrees
Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.

2
Decide on a clear title.
Conversion of pounds sterling to euros (February 2000).
3
Decide on the values that you wish to show on the horizontal axis and the vertical
axis.
As this is a conversion from pounds to euros, the number of euros is dependent on
the number of pounds. Therefore, euros are the dependent values and pounds are
the independent values, so you should plot pounds on the horizontal axis and euros
on the vertical axis. Remember to label the axes clearly.
4
Decide on the scale.
Given the data, it looks sensible to begin both axes from zero. The horizontal axis
needs to go up to at least I2, so a sensible scale is 0 to I3 in steps of one. The
vertical axis needs to go up to almost 8, so a likely scale is O to 8 in steps of one.

ACTIVITY 6
When line graphs are drawn, the scale can often be misleading. Sometimes the graph
seems to show something rather different from the data. This may be deliberate, to
make a point, but sometimes it is accidental, perhaps because the author does not
understand the best way to draw a graph.
To show you what we mean, we would tike you to use the data in Table 2 to draw two
line graphs — both for the total turnover from June to November I999, but one with
the vertical axis starting at £6.5 billion and the other with it starting at zero.

Discussion
See Section 10, page 36.

This section covers bar charts and histograms. We define each of these formats, give
some ideas about when each should be used, and draw some charts and histograms.
You can have a go at drawing a bar chart in Activity 9 and a histogram in Activity 13,
based on data that we supply. The discussions for these activities are in Section 10.
Bar charts
What is a bar chart?
A bar chart is a diagram in which the numerical values of the different variables are
represented by the height or length of lines or rectangles of equal width. The bars or
lines can be drawn vertically or horizontally.
Figure 2 shows three bar charts ilustrating the same data: the first has vertical bars, the
second horizontal bars and the third has lines instead of bars.

When are bar charts used?
A bar chart is a good method of representation if you want to illustrate a set of data in
a way that is as easy to understand as it is simple to read. In general, a bar chart should
be used for data that can be counted so, for example, we could use a bar chart to show
the number of families with o, I, 2 or more children. A bar chart could also be used to
show how many people in one area use each of the different modes of transport to get
to work.
Bar charts are very useful for comparing two or more sets of data, as you will see later.
For example, the popularity of different modes of transport in two cities, or from one
year to the next.
When is a bar chart not a good format to use?
A bar chart is not the best way to show the link or mathematical relationship between
two sets of data, for this you would use a line graph.

--- Page 16 ---
How do I draw a bar chart?
First, you need to decide what it is you want your chart to illustrate. This may be
governed by the data you have access to or you might need to collect the data yourself.
Then the process is as below.
1
Decide on a clear title.
The title should be a brief description of the data that you want to show.
2
Identify how many bars are needed.
The bars correspond to the number of categories you have. For instance, if you are
looking at modes of transport then you might need six bars covering car, bus, train,
motorbike, cycle or walk. A chart about the number of children per family might
have eight bars for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 or more.
Bar charts can be drawn using either horizontal or vertical rectangles or lines.
There are no rules governing which to use, but if the labels for the categories are
quite long. they will easier to read if the bars are on the vertical axis.
3
Identify the scale you need for the other axis.
Look at each category and decide which is the largest; the other axis has to go up
to at least this value. You might also find it useful to check the value of the smallest
category, so that you choose a scale to accommodate all the values. The scale
should start at zero.
4
Draw and label the two axes.
The labels should be simple and as clear as possible. The units should also be
shown, if appropriate.
5
Add the bars.
In a bar chart, strictly speaking, the bars should not touch; each one should be a
separate rectangle. The gap between the rectangles or lines serves to show that the
categories are distinct. You can use a solid line instead of a rectangle or bar, but
you will not see this type of bar chart very often.

ACTIVITY 8
You should now follow our calculation of a bar chart from the information in Table 3.

Discussion
This bar chart has been drawn using vertical bars or rectangles and with a vertical scale of
0400 in steps of 50. The order of the bars reflects the order in which the categories were
given in the data table, but many people would have chosen to put the bars in order of
size, either descending or ascending. Generally speaking, unless the order is obvious from
the categories, for example different years, it doesn't matter what order you use.
This bar chart could also be drawn with horizontal bars as in Figure 4.

As you can see, it is not possible to use either of these charts to read off accurate figures
for the number of miles travelled per person per year using any of the modes of transport
shown. However, both charts give a good idea of the approximate nurnber of miles
travelled using each mode of transport and show how each of the modes of transport
compare.
If it is important that the reader knows exactly what the distances are, either the scale
should be such that the values can be read off accurately (this is not always practical or
possible) or the values should be inserted at the end of each of the bars (Figure 5).

Bar charts can be used to compare two sets of data. Suppose you wanted to compare
the data for average distances travelled per person per year in Paris with similar data for
London (shown in Table 4).

By following the same steps with the London data as with the Paris data, you could put

on the vertical axis to accommodate the much greater distance travelled by rail in
London. The bar chart comparing the two sets of data looks like Figure 6.

Discrete and continuous variables
You may have been wondering why bar charts are generally drawn with separate bars.
There is a reason for this and to discover what it is, you need to look at the nature of
the categories of data being used.
Discrele variables
The charts about different modes of transport and that on attendance figures at a range
of cultural events all use what might be called 'word categories'. Each category (e.g. bus,
rail, cycle, and walk) is quite distinct from any other in the set of categories. Such
distinct categories are known in mathematics as "'discrete variables'.
Word categories are not the only type of variable that is discrete; numbers can also be
discrete. For example, at the beginning of this section, we mentioned that you could use
a bar chart to plot the number of families with o, I, 2 or more children. Here, the
number of children in a family is a discrete variable. So too are the number of goals
scored per match by a football team, and the number of bedrooms in a house. Bar
charts are normally drawn with separate bars in order to emphasize the discrete nature
of the data.
Discrete variables often relate to counted items.
Continuous variables
Not all numbers are discrete. Consider the following measurements:
times to run a marathon
Itemperatures recorded at intervals during a day
I weight of each bunch of grapes sold at a supermarket yesterday.
Time, temperature and weight are all examples of numerical data, but there is not a
restricted set of values that they can take. Whereas you can have 2 or 3 children in a
family but not 2.5, with temperature it is possible to have not only 22 °C and 23 °C but

--- Page 20 ---
also 22.1 °C, 22.25 °C, 22.97 °C as well. This type of variable is restricted only by the
accuracy with which the measurement can be made. Such variables are known as
'continuous variables'.
Continuous variables often relate to measured items.

ACTIVITY 10
Consider a randomly selected group of students living in the UK and continental
Western Europe. You could collect information about, say, their hair colour and their
occupation. What other characteristics of this group could you collect information
about?
Discussion
Here is our list, you may be able to think of others: sex, age, height, number of children,
weight, shoe size, year of birth, nearest city, colour of eyes, first language, country of birth.
Each of these characteristics or variables will produce different sets of data, and each
member of the group of students is likely to be different from at least one other member
of the group for each of these variables. Some variables will have very few categories (e.g
sex has only two: male and fernale) and others too many to list (e.g, nearest city could
include any city in Europe).
As
ACTIVITY II
Now look at your list of variables for the students living in the UK and continental
Western Europe and decide which are discrete and which are continuous.
Discussion
Here is our list:
−
discrete variables
sex
— number of children
- shoe size
- nearest city
— colour of eyes
— first language
- country of birth
— year of birth
continuous variables
- age
- height
- weight
You might have found it difficult to decide where to put the variable year of birth'. A year
is a measurement of time and could be considered as a continuous variable. However, it is
usual to consider a year as a whole number and record inforation relating to a complete
year, which is why we have listed year of birth' as a discrete variable. There are no hard
and fast rules about this; you will find the variables 'year' and 'year of birth' considered as
both discrete and continuous variables.

Histograms
What is a histogram?
The simplest definition of a histogram is that it is a bar chart with the adjacent bars
touching each other. Untike a bar chart, histograms are usually drawn only with vertical
bars. Generally, histograms are used to illustrate continuous data whereas bar charts
are used to illustrate discrete data (distinct categories).
When are histograms used?
A histogram is also a good method of representation if you want to illustrate a set of
data in a way that is as easy to understand as it is simple to read. A histogram should be
used for data that is continuous or has been measured on a continuous number scale.
For example, you could use a histogram to show the number of live births by age of the
mother or the pulse-rates of a group of I00 students (Figure 7). The pulse-rates have
been grouped into intervals of 5 and represent values from 55 to 104 beats per minute.

When is a histogram not a good format to use?
A histogram is not the best way to show a link or mathematical relationship between
two different sets of data.
How do I draw a histogram?
The method for drawing a histogram is very similar to that for a bar chart, but with the
important difference that the bars or rectangles touch.
1
Decide on a clear title.
The title should describe the data you want to illustrate.
2
Identify how many bars are needed along the horizontal axis.
The bars correspond to the number of categories you have. Most histograms have
intervals that are the same size but occasionally you may be asked to draw one with
intervals of differing sizes. It is very important that you always check the size of
each interval, as the width of each rectangle should correspond to its interval size.
The histogram showing pulse rates (above) has equal intervals of 5.
3
Identify the scale you need for the vertical axis.
The size of the largest category determines what value the vertical scale needs to
go up to. It is usual to then mark off intervening values at regular intervals on the
vertical axis. However, the size of these regular intervals will probably be
determined by the sizes of the other categories. The scale should start from zero.
4
Draw and label the two axes.
The labets should be simple and as clear as possible. The units should be shown, if
appropriate.

--- Page 22 ---
5
Add the bars.
The bars of a histogram touch each other but should be visually distinct This serves
to illustrate that the data is continuous and is divided into a number of related
categories.

ACTIVITY 12
You should now follow our calculation of a histogram from the information in Table 6.
100 people were asked to record exactly how much time they spent watching television

As the title should describe the data, we chose "Number of hours of television

want to draw.
2
There are seven categories, so we need seven bars along the horizontal axis. The
intervals are all the same size.
3
The scale for the vertical axis depends on the number of people in each category:
the smallest number is 3, the largest is 32, so the scale can run from 0 to 35 in
intervals of 5.
4
The vertical axis should be labelled 'Number of people' and the horizontal axis
'Hours'.
5
The bars are all the same width (because the intervals on the horizontal axis are all
the same) and should touch each other (Figure 8).

This section covers pie charts. We define the format, give some ideas about when it
should be used, and draw some charts. You can have a go at drawing a pie chart in
Activity 16, based on data that we supply. The discussion for this activity is in Section I0.
What is a pie chart?
A pie chart is a circular chart (pie-shaped); it is split into segments to show percentages
or the relative contributions of categories of data.
When are pie charts used?
A pie chart gives an immediate visual idea of the relative sizes of the shares of a whole.
It is a good method of representation if you wish to compare a part of a group with the
whole group. You could use a pie chart to show, say, advertising income, or market
shares for different brands, or different types of sandwiches sold by a store. Pie charts
don't give very detailed information, but they do give a quick overall impression of your
results. You can add more information into pie charts by inserting figures into each
segment of the chart, or by giving a separate table as a reference. Pie charts are also
useful for comparing two different things. For example, the share of goods that different
supermarkets sell.
When is a pie chart not a good format to use?
A pie chart is not a good format for showing increases and decreases, numbers in each
category, or direct relationships between numbers where one set of numbers depend
on another. In the last case, a line graph would be a better format to use.
How do I draw a pie chart?
You must have data for which you need to show the proportion of each category as a
part of the whole. Then the process is as below.
1
Collect the data so the number per category can be counted.
In other words, decide on the data that you wish to represent and collect it all
together in a forrat that shows shares of the whole.
2
Decide on a clear title.
The title should be a brief description of the data that you wish to show. For
example, if you wish to show market share of brands of washing powder, you could
call the pie chart 'Percentage market share of named brands of washing powder in the
UK in (date)'.
3
Decide on the total number of categories.
In other words, identify the categories that you will use. For example, with washing
powder, there may be dozens of brands on the market, but most of the share of the
market will be held by, say, half a dozen brands. Therefore, you might decide on those
six along with a category called other. It depends very much on what you are trying
to show, but pie charts are likely to be clearest with no more than eight categories.
4
Calculate the degree share in each category.
First, add up the total number of instances that you have. For example, in the case of
washing powders, the total number of instances might be the number of units sold in
a year, so the share of the whole for each category would be the number of units
sold in that category. To calculate degree share, you need to divide the share that the
category has by the total units and then multiply by 360 (there are 360 degrees () in
a circle).
So, if there are 200 units in all, and:
40
category A has 40 units, its degree share =
200
x 360 = 72°

--- Page 25 ---
category B has 80 units, its degree share =
80
200
× 360°= 144
category C has 50 units, its degree share =
so
200
x 360°= 90°
category D has 30 units, its degree share =
30
200
× 360°= 54°
5
Make a final check that the number of degrees adds up to 36o, then draw the pie
chart.

2
Decide on a clear title.
Title: '1992 tllinois population by race (thousands)".
3
Decide on the total number of responses.
The number of categories is four (the four races).
4
Calculate the degree share in each category.
As an example, here is the calculation of the degree share for African-Americans:
1756
11614
x 360 = 54 (to nearest whole degree).
The degree share for each category is shown in Table 9.
Alternatively, you could calculate the percentage share of each category.
Percentage share is calculated as follows (for the share of African-Americans):
1756
11614
x 100 = 15 (to nearest whole number).

If you are working by hand, it is best to work to the nearest whole number because
it is hard to be more accurate than this when drawing. Make a final check that the
number of degrees adds up to 360, then draw the pie chart (Figure 9). If you are
using a computer to draw the chart, the raw data will be enough and the computer
will do the calculation for you.

ACTIVITY 16
Now you can try drawing up a pie chart for yourself from the information below.
The Retail Price Index (RPl) is a UK index that looks at the expenditure habits and costs
in the UK of a "basket' of goods. The basket contains all the consumer goods that an
'average' household can expect to buy over time, 60o in total. Two groups of
households are excluded from this, to make it more representative: pensioners and the
high earners. 120,oo0 measurements are taken each month. The index is calculated
monthly, and you may be aware of it as the basis for the monthly headline inflation rate.
The 600 consumer goods are split into areas of general consumption, such as food or
housing. Table I0 shows some data on the relative expenditure of an 'average'
household on goods in the housing sector of the basket The relative expenditure on
each of these goods is expressed in terms of a weight So, for example, Table I0 shows
that in I998, in the 'average' household, three times as much was spent on council tax
and rates as was spent on repairs and maintenance. As can be seen from the table, these
weights change from year to year as expenditure changes. This is just a part of the data
from the RPI.

Discussion
See Section 10, page 38.

--- Page 28 ---
Charts, graphs and tables are all very helpful ways of representing a set of data.
However they are not the only ways of passing on information about data. This section
looks at how you can analyse a set of data to summarize the given information as briefly
and simply as possible.
Essentially, there are two features of a set of data that enable summarizing: the average
and the spread. This section starts by looking at what is meant by 'average'. If you have
atready read Student Toolkit 3 Working with Charts, Graphs and Tables, this will be
familiar to you. However, we recommend that even if you do not read this part, you do
try Activity 17. The section then considers frequency tables before moving on to look at
spread.
Averages
Mean, median and mode
The mean, median and mode are all types of average and are typical of the data they
represent. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and can be used in different
situations, but they all give us an idea of the general size of the values involved. Here we
provide brief definitions, and some idea of when each should be used.
The following set of data is the number of mites (to the nearest mile) walked in a week
by a group of students. You are going to look at how to calculate the mean, median and
mode of these values.
Data set A: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15
Mean
The mean is found by adding up all the values in a set of numbers and dividing that total
by the number of values in the set.
For data set A, the total is 107. There are I6 values, so you need to divide I07 by I6.
This gives 6.6875. So, the mean of this set of data is 6.6875 miles.
You also need to consider to how many decimal places you should quote. It is unlikely
that the distance walked by each of the students would have been a complete number
of miles, but the actual values have been rounded to the nearest whole number. As a
result, you can only give the mean correct to one decimal place, or even to the nearest
mile. Rounding 6.6875 to one decimal place gives 6.7 miles. If you look at the data, you
will see that 6.7 seems to be quite a good average measure of these values.
Many people would choose to calculate the mean of a set of data if they wanted to get
an idea of a typical value of the set, but there are times when the mean isn't as
representative as you would like. For instance, if one of these students were a very keen
walker, the largest value could have been, say, 50 miles not 15. If you replace the i5 by
50 and then recalculate the mean, the answer you get is 8.875 or 8.9 correct to one
decimal place. Thus, the one value of 5o has significantly increased the value of the mean
such that it is now less representative of the group of data as a whole.
Another problem with using the mean is that sometimes when you calculate the mean
of a set of data, the value you get is difficult to interpret. For example, if you calculate
the mean number of children in a group of families, you could get a value like 2. 1 or 2.3.
Of course, it is not possible to have 2.3 children.
Median
The median is the middle value of a set of numbers arranged in ascending (or
descending) order. If the set has an even number of values, then the median is the mean

--- Page 29 ---
Data set A is already in ascending order: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 11, 1, 13, 16
This is a set of I6 numbers, so the median is the mean of the two middle numbers,
which are underlined (8h and 9h data values); the median is:
{6+6)÷2=6
In some ways, this value is more representative of the group. For data set A, the median
telts us that half the group walk 6 miles or less and half the group walk 6 miles or more.
Here it doesn't matter what the largest (or the smallest) value is; if the largest value
were 50, the median would still be 6.
Mode
The mode (or modal value) is the most popular value in a set of numbers, that is the
one that occurs most often.
Looking at data set A, you can see that the mode is 6. In other words, more people
walked 6 miles than any other distance.
The value of the mode, like the median, is not affected by any particularly large or small
values in the set.
While every set of data has a mean and a median, it is not always possible to find a
mode. Some sets of data have only single instances of each value, other sets of data have
more than one value that occurs equally often.

Naturally, this is not always the case and you need to consider how to work with a

that the scripts were marked.

An array of scores, presented tike this is hard to read and to interpret, so you need to
rewrite the information in a way that makes it easier to understand.
First, arrange the 30 scores in (ascending) order of size:
42
53
56
60
65
66
73

93
96
Now that the data has been arranged in order it is called a distribution.
If you look at this distribution, you can see that all the scores tie between 42 and 96,
and you can find the median. In this case, the median is the mean of the ISth and 16th
scores (underlined above):
(84 + 85) ÷2 = 84.5
In order to find the mean score, you need to add up all the scores and divide by 30.
This is a fairly laborious task so you don't have to do this unless you want to check our
answer. The total of all the scores is 2399 and, as there are 30 scores, the mean for this
set of data is 8o (to the nearest whole number).
It is not possible to find the modal score for this set of data as there are two scores
that occur three times, 84 and 92.
Even with the mean and the median for data set B, it is still quite difficult to get a feel for
the distribution of these scores. There is one further thing that you can do and that is
to group the data into 10-mark intervals.
Score

This is called a grouped frequency distribution. It makes the overall pattern of the data
more clear but you have now lost information about the individual scores.
If you now draw a graph using this information, the pattern will be even clearer. Note
that, as this data has been grouped into intervals of Io, you should use a histogram to
illustrate this data (Figure 11).

Figure 1I Student TMA scores
Although there is no modal value for the individual values of data set B, you can now
see that there is a modal group or class. This is the group of scores 80-89.
It is not possible to find the precise value of the median from the frequency distribution
or histogram. The best you can do is to identify the group that contains the median by
adding up the frequencies of each of the groups until you have included the 15th and 16th
score. The total of the first four groups is I 1 and for the first five groups is 22 so that
the 15t and 16th scores must fall within the fifth group, which is the modal group 80-89.
From the histogram and frequency distribution, you can see that most of scores fall in
the upper two groups, 80-89 and 90-99. However, the value of the mean was 80, which
is at the lower end of these groups. This set of values has a small number of rather low
scores and these have the effect of pulling down the mean as compared to the median.
This effect is similar to that of the large distance walked by one of the group of students
affecting the value of the mean in data set A.
Spread
Range and inter-quartile range
So far in this section, you have seen that the mean, median and mode can all give a
useful typical value of a set of data. However, there is further information that you can
get from a set of data which can help to complete the picture.
Consider the following two sets of data.
Data set C: I13, 48, 26, 99, 64 The number of runs scored by a cricket batsman in a
5-week period.
Data set D: 72, 69, 74, 71, 70 A person's pulse first thing in the morning, measured
over 5 days.
The mean for data set C is 70 and the mean for the data set D is 71.2.

ACTIVITY 18
What do you think is the most striking difference between these two sets of data?
Discussion
You might have said that the values in the first set are quite varied but the values in the
second set are all very sirnilar to one another. This is an important difference between the
two sets of data.
It is useful to calculate the range of a set of values.
The smallest value in data set C is 26 and the largest is I13, so the range is I13 - 26 = 87.
The smallest value in data set D is 69 and the largest is 74, so the range is 74 - 69 = 5.

--- Page 32 ---
The range is easy to calculate and gives you a rough idea of how spread out the values
in a set of data are. However, it does need to be treated with caution. The range
depends on the two extreme values in a set of data and it is quite possible that one or
both of them is untypical of the set.
Aon
ACTIVITY 19
Here are two sets of data. Which would you say was the more spread out?
Data set E: 1, 3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 17, 20
Data set F: 1, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, 20
Discussion
The range of both these sets of data is 20 - I = 19. However, data set E is more spread
out than the data set F. Clearly, you need sore way of spotting this, especially if you have a
large number of values in your set of data.
In order to get a more accurate picture, you need to calculate a smaller range, nearer
to the middte of the distribution, which avoids the extreme values.
The range to use is based on the quartiles of the distribution and is called the inter-
quartile range. You already know how to find the median, which divides the set of
values into two equal parts, so you now need to divide each of these two parts into two
equal parts to get the quartiles. You might like to think of the quartiles dividing the
range into quarters or four parts.
Consider data set E again:
1, 3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 17, 20
The median of this set of data is the mean of the two underlined numbers:
(8 + 10)÷2= 9.
You now need to find the median of the first 6 values in the set; this value is
(4 + 4) ÷ 2 = 4. The median of the second 6 values is (15 + 17) ÷ 2 = 16.
Thus, data set E can be divided into four parts by the three quartiles, Q, Q and Q3
with the second, Q2, having the same value as the median. The values used to calculate
the quartiles are underlined.
1, 3,4
4, 7, 8
10, 14, 15
17, 17, 20
Qj = 4
Q2= 9
Q3 =16
Note that medians and quartiles may or may not be equal to one of the data values. You
can now calculate the inter-quartile range, Q3 - Qj: 16  4 = I2. This gives a measure
of the spread of the middle So% of the data values.
V
ACTIVITY 20
Using data set F, calculate the quartiles and the inter-quartile range.
Data set F 1, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11. 11, 11, 20
Discussion
The median is (9 + 9) ÷ 2 = 9. The first quartile Qi is (8 + 8) ÷ 2 = 8. The third quartile
the values used to calculate the quartiles are underlined.

This glossary is intended to provide a basic explanation of how a number of common
mathematical terms are used. Definitions can be very slippery and confusing and at worst
can replace one difficult term with a large number of other puzzling concepts. Therefore,
where an easy definition is available it is provided here, where this has not been possible
an example is used. If you require more detailed or complete definitions, you should
refer to one of the very good mathematical dictionaries that are available, or to one or
more books listed in the bibliography.
Approximation: A numerical result given to a required level of accuracy, for example,
to the nearest metre.
Average: The word 'average' is often used instead of the word 'mean' but it can have
other interpretations so it is best to use the appropriate correct term; this is usually
'mean', but may be 'median' or 'mode' (see below).
Chart: Pictorial representation of data e.g. pie chart, bar chart.
Continuous data: Values that cannot be given exactly. This data is usually a
measurement tike time, height or temperature.
Data: Items of numerical information, raw facts or statistics collected together for
analysis.
Decimals: A way of expressing numbers using place value, e.g. 0.5 = = 2,
1.75 =
175
100
= $\frac{ }$
Discrete data: Values that are clearly separated from one another, e.g. shoe sizes or
modes of transport.
Fractions: Parts of a whole number, e.g.
I
37
24100
etc.
Graph: A drawing which depicts the relationship between data or values.
Inter-quartite range: The range of the values between the first and third quartile.
Mean: A typical value of a set of data, which is equal to the sum of the values in the set
divided by the number of values in the set.
Median: The middle point of a set of values arranged in ascending or descending order.
Mode: The most common value in a set of data.
Percentage: A proportion of a hundred parts, e.g. 75% =
175
100
Quartile: Each of the three values that divide a set of data into four equal groups.
Ratio: A comparison of one quantity with another.
Scale: A series of marks at regular intervals on a line used for measuring, e.g. the
divisions on the axis of a graph or the degree markings on a thermometer.
Value: A numerical amount.

I
Collect the data.
You have the data in the table, and you wish to show total tumover against time.
2
Decide on a clear title.
In this case, the heading of Table 2 seems to be suitable.
3
Decide on the values that you wish to show on the horizontal axis and the vertical
axis.
The independent variable in this case is time, so you need to plot it on the horizontal
axis. As the data in Table 2 is in months, use these for the graph. The dependent value is
the total tumover, so you need to plot it on the vertical axis, in £ billion. Remember to
label the axes.
4
Decide on the scale.
You should use months on the horizontal axis in both line graphs. In the first line graph,
you should start the vertical axis at 6.5, just below the minimum value; in the second line
graph, you should start the vertical axis at zero.

--- Page 38 ---

Plot the graph.
Using 6.5 as the starting point on the vertical axis, your graph should look like Figure 12.

Discussion
The obvious difference is that change between the months seers to be much greater in
the graph where the vertical axis starts at £6.5 bilion. This is because the total scale on the
vertical axis is much smaller than in the second graph, where the vertical axis starts at O. If
you wished to use the line graph to show that tumover is fluctuating strongly, you might
prefer to use the first graph, whereas if you wished to suggest that the fluctuations were
not overty strong, you might prefer the second graph
Take a look around you at the line graphs (and other graphs and diagrars) that you see,
and notice how many of them have a particular erphasis because of a misleading use of
scale.

The title of this bar chart can be the same as that of Table 5 'Attendance at cultural

There are eight categories listed in Table 5, so you need eight bars. We have chosen to

Identify the scale you need for the other axis.
The largest percentage is 50% and the srnallest is 3%, so the scale on the horizontal axis
could go frorn 0 to 60 in steps of 5.
4
Draw and label the two axes.
The horizontal axis should be labelled 'Percentage of adult population' but the vertical
axis probably doesn't need a label, as the categories are self-explanatory.

Add the bars.
The bars for the categories can be given in the order listed or you could put thern in

The title of this histogram is not as obvious as you might think. You could go for
'Number of live births by age of the mother in the UK in I997' or 'Age-specific birth
rates in the UK in I997'. We chose 'Live birth rates in the UK in I997'.
2
There are six intervals, each spanning 5 years, which means that each of the six
necessary rectangles should be the same width. Note, for example, that the I519
interval includes those mothers who have just turmned I5 up to those who are about
to tum 20.
3
The largest number of live births per I000 women is t04 and the smallest is 7. This
would suggest a scale that goes from O to I l0 in steps of 10.
4
The axes should both be long enough for the chart to be easily read. The longer the
vertical axis, the more accurately the height of the rectangles can be judged. The
horizontal axis should be labelled 'Age group of mother in years' and the vertical axis,
'Live births per T0oo woren'.
5
The bars should be in order of ascending age. Your histogram should look like
